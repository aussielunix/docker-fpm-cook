# fpm-cookery Docker image

This is an docker image  based on Ubuntu 14.0.4 with ruby compiled from source.  
It also has fpm-cookery installed.


To see this in action check out https://github.com/aussielunix/hugo-packages where I am using circleci's docker support for building packages with fpm-cookery.
